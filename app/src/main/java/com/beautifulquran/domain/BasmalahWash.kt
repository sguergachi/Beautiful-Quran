/**
 * Where the ink wash across the basmalah calligraphy stands at a given moment
 * of the lead-in clip — the same word↔voice lock the verse words have, applied
 * to a single piece of artwork.
 *
 * The clip is Al-Fatihah 1:1 (`001001.mp3`), so its four word timings are
 * already in the DB and are the honest clock: the wash crosses ٱللَّهِ when the
 * reciter says "-llāhi", not a fixed fraction of the file. Two things make that
 * more than a linear ramp:
 *
 * - **Word bands.** The Naskh composition is not proportional to time. Its
 *   elongated sīn (the long kashida) gives بِسۡمِ over half the width for a
 *   ~0.5 s syllable, while ٱلرَّحِيمِ — where the reciter spends more than half
 *   the clip — occupies less than a quarter. Each word therefore owns the band
 *   of artwork its glyphs actually cover ([WORD_END_PROGRESS]); the edge
 *   sweeps out along the kashida and then ambles through the dense cluster.
 * - **Tajweed inside the band.** With a [TajweedPacing.Hold], the wash parks
 *   where the voice parks: the madd of ٱلرَّحۡمَٰنِ, and the madd ʿāriḍ of the
 *   closing ٱلرَّحِيمِ, which is most of the clip's dwell
 *   ([TajweedPacing.Hold.maddAaridWaqf]).
 *
 * Pure Kotlin, unit-tested on the JVM. Progress is monotone in [positionMs]:
 * the bands ascend and [TajweedPacing.Curve] is monotone, so no frame can move
 * the wash backwards (docs/DESIGN.md — the wash never resets mid-animation).
